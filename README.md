# Decentralized Ticketing System

## Project Description
The **Decentralized Ticketing System** is a blockchain-based platform for creating, buying, and selling event tickets. Built on the Stellar blockchain, this system uses smart contracts to ensure the authenticity of tickets, manage ticket transfers, and handle payments securely in Lumens (XLM). By leveraging decentralized technology, the platform minimizes issues like ticket scalping and counterfeiting, providing users with a transparent, secure, and efficient ticketing experience.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a secure, transparent, and accessible ticketing system that eliminates fraud, ticket scalping, and counterfeit tickets. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to empower event organizers and ticket buyers with a trusted platform where every ticket is traceable, transferable, and verified through smart contracts.

## Key Features
- **Smart Contract-Backed Ticketing**: Each ticket is minted as a unique asset on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity and transparency.
- **Secure Payments in Lumens (XLM)**: All ticket purchases and transfers are handled through Stellar's fast and cost-effective Lumens (XLM) cryptocurrency, ensuring seamless transactions.
- **Immutable Ownership Records**: Every ticket is tied to an on-chain record of ownership, preventing fraudulent sales or duplicate tickets.
- **Transfer Management**: Smart contracts allow users to transfer tickets securely while maintaining full transparency and record-keeping of all transfers.
- **Anti-Scalping Mechanism**: Implementing limits and rules for ticket resale, preventing price gouging and scalping practices.
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: The entire ticketing process is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing manipulation.
